# Job-Application-Form

## About:
Welcome to my basic job application form, which I created using HTML and CSS to gain a better understanding of these languages. As a beginner in web development, I am eager to learn and improve my skills. Through building this form, I have delved into the basics of HTML and CSS and learned how they can be used to create a simple yet functional job application form.
